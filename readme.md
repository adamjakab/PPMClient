PPM EXTENSION
=============

Project is yet unusable!

After "npm install" (not yet registered) you should have a fully working
PPMClient directory which can be loaded in Google Chrome with the "Load unpacked extension..."
button.

If you are not using npm, run "npm install" and "bower" in the project root.
