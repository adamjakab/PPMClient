Paranoia Password Manager 2 (client)
====================================

Project is yet unusable!

To set up the development environment, do:


```shell script
git clone git@github.com:adamjakab/PPMClient.git
yarn install
grunt
```

Now should have a fully working PPMClient directory (the one with the manifest.json file inside)
which can be loaded in Google Chrome with the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
